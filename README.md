## Why I Took This Course

I enrolled in the ["NodeJS Tutorial and Projects Course"](https://www.udemy.com/share/104VV03@er19hlJXwmWoAYVjMi0kPZkpb-4ylXAp09Zhx8fYzcgHHRcbQiVvjE9COIG7xgvnZw==/) on Udemy to expand my knowledge of Node.js and refine my skills in creating scalable server-side applications. The course offers practical projects and in-depth tutorials, providing an excellent opportunity for hands-on experience and mastering essential concepts. I'm eager to apply the insights gained from this course to real-world projects and progress further in my web development career. ðŸš€

I'll also be using the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/) to further my understanding and ensure I grasp all the concepts thoroughly.

## What is NodeJS?

The way I see it, NodeJS is an environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of a web browser. Launched in 2009, NodeJS is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, which is responsible for converting our code to machine code in the browser. Each browser has its own engine, and Chrome's is called V8. Since its creation, NodeJS has grown remarkably. What stands out about NodeJS is its vast community, which can save significant time during development. Plus, NodeJS simplifies the process of building full-stack applications, as you can use JavaScript for both the front end and back end, making everything more streamlined.
